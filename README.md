# NC ENGINE
 A 2D console engine header file + examples. **FOR WINDOWS!**

## Read Before Cloning/Installing/Using
    1. **This is NOT a fully-featured, sprite-based game engine.** It lets you declare objects that have a 'charmap', a simple two dimensional array of characters of any width/height up to 64.
    2. **This engine is designed for simpler games.** I do not recommend making the next big MMO with this. Of course, if you find out *how*, make sure to tell me about it ;D.
    3. **You MUST state what engine your game uses; in this case, NC Engine (standing for nord console engine, of course)
